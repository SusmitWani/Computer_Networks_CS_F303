# Computer_Networks_CS_F303_Labs
All the codes and assignments for the Computer Networks Course held in the second semester of the academic year 2020-2021

All codes come with a readme file. Please refer to the file for instructions on how to run it. 


## Lab 1
This lab is just the demonstration of some of the terminal commands used in networking

## Lab 2
This lab is application of the commands learnt in the first lab.

## Lab 3
This lab is about learning the basics of wireshark

## Lab 4
This lab is an alternating messaging application between a server and a client using named pipes.

## Lab 5
In this lab, I implement a TCP based server and clients which are situated in separate directories and the client requests files from the server. The server checks if file is available and sends it to the client if it is.

## Midsem Lab
Chat application but return chat in opposite order. Also capturing wireshark packets for the same.

## Lab 6
Lab in which I design the server to accept a limited number of clients, in my case, maximum 4 concurrent users. The application is a chat application.

## Lab 7
Lab in which I designed a client program which accepts the URL of any file on the internet and downloads the file.

## Lab 8
Lab in which I use wireshark to study the DHCP and arp packets

## Lab 9
Lab in which I code a encoder and a decoder using the OpenSSL library which can encrypt and decrypt text files upto 1KB.

## Lab Comprehensive exam
Lab in which I make a end to end encrypted chatting application. Two clients communicate by means of a server in my implementation. Can be made into an actual chatroom by changing a parameter.

## Notes:
Lab 7 code not able to download images. Last tested on Ubuntu 18.04 on a VM
