Two files are given. 
1) client.c
2) server.c

Compile and run both files in two separate terminals. 
The client terminal will be the first to message the server. Type in your message and once we press enter, the message will appear in both the terminals. The next message will be sent by the server.

Once we type exit in either terminal, the respective program will terminate and an indication will be sent to the other terminal. The other terminal can send messages but will not be able to get them delivered.
